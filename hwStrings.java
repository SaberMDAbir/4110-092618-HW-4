HW 4
A character double occurs when the same character occurs twice in a
row, such as the "mm" in "programming". Note the character could
be a symbol, such as "--" or "!!". For example, the words below all
contain character doubles: Hello, good, x++, followâ€¦
Write a full Java program that counts the number of character doubles
in a phrase entered by the user. The output should look like the
example below.
Enter phrase: Follow Programming Concepts!!
Output: There are 3-character doubles.
You do not have to worry about detecting upper vs. lower-case
letters, nor do you have to handle the case when a character occurs
three times or more in a row
